# weather-forecast

## Description
This project involves using HTML, Css, and JavaScript, to create a weather dashboard. The dashboard contains the current weather and 5 day forecast of a random city. This is done through an OpenWeather API key and documentation. The user will input a city name into the form block and the three details will be shown: temperature (in celcius), humidity (in percentage), and wind speed (in MPH). The time and date is also displayed, through dayjs. The data will then be put through a forloop.
